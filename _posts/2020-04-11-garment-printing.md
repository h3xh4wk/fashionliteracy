Printing plays a crucial role in increasing the value of the garment and making
it desirable for the consumers. The process of garment printing has evolved
over time from the most basic technology of screen printing to the most
advanced technology of digital printing. The quality and finish achieved varies
in different technologies. In this article, the three different levels – basic,
intermediate and advanced are discussed.


## Introduction


T-shirt printing i.e. garment printing is very different from fabric printing
or panel printing as a garment is three dimensional and care needs to be taken
regarding the transfer of the color on the lower panel. The machinery involved
in garment printing essentially includes a frame in which the garment is
inserted so that only the top layer is exposed to the printing head. Digital
printing has enabled manufacturers to increase their production more than three
fold as compared to screen printing.


## Screen Printing

T-Shirt screen printing machines are the rotary type with a specified number of
screens ranging from 4 to 18. Various models of manual, as well as automatic
printers, are available in the market. While manual models have features like
indexing pin, multi-directional micro registration etc, the automatic models
have servo driven index system, control panels for each station, pneumatic
screen clamping, and automatic start-finish, multiprint etc feature making the
process easier and more automated.  


Screen printing for T-shirt printing works on the same principle as the
traditional screen printing process. In the first stage, the screens are
prepared according to the design and the number of colours used. For each
colour, a separate screen has to be made. There are various processes of
preparing the screen, but generally, for the industrial purpose the screen is
coated with the photosensitive emulsion and the artwork is made using the
lightbox method. 


The screen is then loaded. Meanwhile, the t-shirts also need to be prepped for
better absorption of colour. Colour recipes are prepared to get the desired hue
and dispensed on the screens. The t-shirt is then mounted and the colour is
squeezed through the screen and the screen is lifted up. The process is
repeated with all the specified number of screens until the design is completed
and contains all the desired colours. The t-shirt is then cured for making the
prints long lasting.


Automatic machines start from Rs 10 Lakh and can go up to Rs 40 Lakh. The
maximum print area is 16" x 18" which is more than the size of A3 paper. The
maximum screen size it can accommodate is 23" x 33". Three types of
specifications are available i.e. 


>1. AAA=air lift, air index, air heads 
>2. ASA=air lift, servo index, air heads 
>3. ASE=air lift, servo index, electric heads. 


Technologies like touchscreen control panel, servo lift, indexing, electric
print head give perfect results. But the drawback inherent to the screen
printing always remains. The process becomes repetitive, there is a limitation
of colours and the machines become bulky to accommodate all the screens and
workstations.

## Heat Transfer (Sublimation)


Sublimation printing eliminates the need of making a separate screen for each
colour and the process time is reduced as all the colours are transferred to
the garment in one application as opposed to the screen printing where each
colour has to be squeezed through a separate screen. 


The principle behind sublimation printing is the chemical bonding of the colour
with the substrate. Hence it is more durable than the screen prints provided
right pressure, temperature and time is used.  Sublimation transfer simplifies
and reduces the process to just two steps.


1. Printing on the transfer paper
2. Heat pressing colour on the garment


First step is to print the design by an inkjet printer on a transfer paper. The
second step is to transfer the design from the paper to the garment using a
heat press machine. Heat press machine consists of a nonstick coated heat plate
and a frame in which the t-shirt is inserted and the handle is pressed to bring
down the heat plate on to the t-shirt. The pressure of 40 psi is applied at
400o F for 45 seconds so completely transfer the pigments to the fabric. The
paper is then peeled off while it is warm. Initially, sublimation printing was
used only for polyester fabric but now it is used for a wide variety of fiber
contents and blends. (Grifford, 2016)


The machine used to transfer the sublimation print on the t-shirt is called
sublimation heat press. It starts from as low as Rs 15000 and goes up to Rs 3
Lakh depending upon the level of automation. Manual machines may have a handle
to press down the heat plate while the automatic one operates pneumatically. In
automatic presses, there is an option of auto opening but often this leads to a
fault called "ghosting" due to the shifting of the garment. Three important
factors are considered in a machine i.e. Platen configuration, Platen size and
mode of operation (manual or pneumatic). (Lamb, 2017)


Platen configuration specifies how the press opens and closes. Clamshell is the
most common type of heat press. Swing away and drawer type is less common.
Platen size determines the maximum size of the print. Commonly used sizes are
20" x 24" and 14" x 20". The heat press is operated either manually or may be
pneumatically controlled wherein its air pressure is used to open and close the
press and also for applying the pressure.


The major drawback of the heat press printing process is the wastage of
transfer paper. For each print, one sheet is required and can't be reused for
more prints like screens in screen printing.

## Digital Printing (DTG)

Digital printing on T-shirts is also called Direct –to- Garment printing. DTG
printing eliminates the woes of multiple screens of screen printing and n
number of transfer papers of sublimation printing. The process is simplified to
the highest degree. Printing directly on the t-shirt is as simple as taking a
paper printout owing to this machine. Colour options are limitless (over 16
million colours) and time is significantly reduced as compared to other two
technologies. Also, minimum order quantity is not a constraint as in screen
printing.  


The process of digital printing starts with curing of the t-shirts to attain
maximum colour penetration. Then the artwork is prepared using GTX Graphics Lab
Software or related software to get a high-resolution file. Then the platen is
loaded with t-shirts and the artwork is printed. The printed t-shirt is cured
for optimum result. (Brother, 2017)


The only machine required for digital printing is a DTG inkjet printer which
can print a high-resolution image on the t-shirt. The artwork should be of
resolution 300dpi and higher. The formats accepted for printing are jpeg, png,
ai, pdf, psd etc. The essential parts of the printer are cartridge holder,
platen, and print head. Platen size can be up to 16” x 20”. Up to 25 mm thick
fabric can be printed. (Epson, 2017)


Digital printing enables the production to increase 4 folds and reduces the
printing cost by 30 to 60%. Industrial DTG printers like Kornit Avalanche can
print up to 150 T-shirts per hour.  It is easier to set and the payback period
is very less. Hence these days the T-shirt printing companies willing to invest
in Digital Direct –To- Garment Printing.  (Kornit, 2017)

## Conclusion

Although different technology serves different purposes as the quality
delivered varies. The technology must be chosen considering all the parameters
like the industry, product, MOQ, customer requirement etc. For example, if the
requirement never increases above 5 to 6 colours then screen printing can be
considered, although if the customer wants to go for multiple colours then
digital printing serves best for this purpose. For low investment and new
start-up usually, heat press is the most favorable option as the machine cost
is minimum and the payback period is very less.
