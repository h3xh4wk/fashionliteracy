## Points in against of the topic

<!--Khadi; Image Courtesy: www.dealhome.in-->

* Khadi is handspun and hand-woven and hence has limited aesthetic appeal
* Limited types of fibers can be used - cotton, silk, wool
* Technologically way behind than latest fashion fabrics like Liva
* Deep-rooted sentiments such as nationalism and freedom are associated with khadi and such people might be reluctant to accept bold designs and patterns prevalent in latest fashion trends.
* Khadi mostly demonstrates patriotism and is usually adopted by politicians and intellectuals.
* Limited techniques of dyeing and printing can be implemented.
* Portrays modesty.
* Considered to be a rustic fabric, not projecting modernism and luxury.
* Production is hampered by the unorganized nature of the khadi industry.
* Khadi production seems to be totally in control of the government.
* There is debate among designers regarding the versatility of the fabric.
* Khadi-look does not work with the young generation.
* There is nothing special in khadi other than the sentiments like swaraj, freedom, self-reliance, and patriotism.
